# Using the 7 Segments Display.
It is simple & fun project. It uses STM32F051R8T6 MCU and two HS310561K(scheme in docs) displays. Connections are in display_codes.h file.
After reset it shows some startup animation on displays and running line "HELLO PEOPLE ". Then after button(PA0) press it counts some number and displays it.
